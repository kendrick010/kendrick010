### Hi there, I am Kendrick 👋

I am an undergraduate EE at the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)** with a concentration in Computer System Design. I love dabbling in technologies and projects that deeply interact between hardware and software. I hope to develop products/devices that can have a high impact within the industry.

- 🌱 I’m currently passionate in learning more software development practices and machine learning frameworks
