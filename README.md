### Hi there, I am Kendrick 👋

I am an undergraduate EE at the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)** with a concentration in Computer System Design. I love dabbling in technologies and projects that deeply interact between hardware and software. I am currently passionate in learning more software development, data science, and machine learning frameworks practices and applications.
