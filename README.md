### Hi there, I am Kendrick 👋

I am a M.S. student at the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)** studying Machine Learning & Data Science under the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department. I also recently finished my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Cognitive Science at UCSD. I love dabbling in technologies and projects that deeply interact between hardware and software. I am currently passionate in learning more software development, data science, and machine learning frameworks practices and applications.
