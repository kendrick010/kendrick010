### Hi there, I am Kendrick 👋

I am an undergraduate EE at the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)** with a concentration in Computer System Design. I love dabbling in technologies and projects that deeply interact between hardware and software. I hope to develop products/devices that can have a high impact within the industry

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [IoT Geologger Device](https://github.com/kendrick010/car_geo_logger)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSAs through an interactive [Stepik](https://stepik.org/579) course
